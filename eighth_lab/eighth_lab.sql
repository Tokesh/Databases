--1E Returns two outputs, but has one input

/*
2. Create a trigger that:
a. Return timestamp of the occured action within the database.
b. Computes the age of a person when personsâ€™ date of birth is inserted.
c. Adds 12% tax on the price of the inserted item.
d. Prevents deletion of any row from only one table.
e. Launches functions 1.d and 1.e.

/*
  3 What is the difference between procedure and function?
    Procedures can be reused and shared by multiple programs.
    Procedures can access or modify data in a database
  A procedure does not have a return type. But it returns values using the OUT parameters.
  You can use DML queries such as insert, update, select etcâ€¦ with procedures.
  A procedure allows both input and output parameters.
  You can manage transactions inside a procedure.
  You can call a function from a stored procedure.
  You cannot call a procedure using select statements.

/*
4.Create procedures that:
a) Increases salary by 10% for every 2 years of work experience and provides
10% discount and after 5 years adds 1% to the discount.
b) After reaching 40 years, increase salary by 15%. If work experience is more
than 8 years, increase salary for 15% of the already increased value for work
experience and provide a constant 20% discount.
